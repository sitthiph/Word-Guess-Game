## How to play
Hit the start button and you can play right away by typing the letters to the secret word or phrase! You get 10 wrong guesses before you lose. Hope you brushed up on your knowledge! If you win the game, you will be treated to a victory message. If you lose the game, you will get the dreaded defeat message. After guessing or not guessing the secret word or phrase, the answer will be revealed.

## How it works
This game uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to run. The Javascript only uses built in functions, and is designed around a game state object. Player input is intercepted via key presses (binding game functions to the document.keyup event).
